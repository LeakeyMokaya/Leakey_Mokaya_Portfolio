Data Science Portfolio

In a data science portfolio, you can typically have several categories of projects, each showcasing different skills, techniques, and domains of expertise. Some common categories of projects for a data science portfolio include:

1. Regression Projects: These projects involve building models to predict continuous outcomes, such as house prices, stock prices, or sales revenue.
2. Classification Projects: Classification projects focus on categorizing data into predefined classes, such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, or disease diagnosis.
3. Clustering Projects: Clustering projects involve grouping similar data points together based on their characteristics, such as customer segmentation or anomaly detection.
4. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects: NLP projects deal with processing and analyzing textual data, such as sentiment analysis, text classification, or language translation.
5. Time Series Forecasting Projects: Time series forecasting projects involve predicting future values based on historical time-series data, such as stock prices, weather forecasts, or demand forecasting.
6. Deep Learning Projects: Deep learning projects utilize deep neural networks to solve complex tasks, such as image recognition, speech recognition, or natural language understanding.
7. Recommendation System Projects: Recommendation system projects focus on building systems that suggest relevant items to users based on their preferences and behavior, such as movie recommendations or product recommendations.
8. Anomaly Detection Projects: Anomaly detection projects involve identifying unusual patterns or outliers in data, such as fraudulent transactions, network intrusions, or equipment failures.
9. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects: EDA projects focus on exploring and visualizing datasets to gain insights and understand underlying patterns or trends in the data.
10. Data Visualization Projects: Data visualization projects involve creating visual representations of data to communicate insights effectively, such as interactive dashboards, charts, or infographics.
