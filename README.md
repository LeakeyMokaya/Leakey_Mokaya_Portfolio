Below are project overviews and skills learned for each of the projects listed:

1.Customer Segmentation and Behavioral Analysis
Project Overview: Use machine learning clustering techniques (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering) to segment customers based on purchasing behavior, demographics, and engagement metrics from a dataset resembling e-commerce transactions or customer interaction logs.
Objective: To identify distinct customer groups to tailor marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and enhance personalized recommendations.
Skills Demonstrated: Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering algorithms, data visualization, and interpretation of results to drive business decisions.
2. Sales Forecasting Model
Project Overview: Develop a predictive model to forecast sales for a retail company or any business sector of interest, using historical sales data, external factors like holidays and economic indicators, and possibly sentiment analysis of customer reviews.
Objective: To enable the business to optimize inventory management, plan marketing strategies, and make informed financial decisions.
Skills Demonstrated: Time series analysis, regression models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet), feature engineering, model evaluation, and deployment of the model for real-time forecasting.
3. Social Media Sentiment Analysis for Brand Perception
Project Overview: Utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze social media data (e.g., Twitter, Reddit) to gauge public sentiment towards a brand or product. This can involve sentiment scoring and trend analysis over time or in response to specific events or campaigns.
Objective: To provide insights into public perception, identify areas for improvement, and track the impact of marketing campaigns or public relations efforts.
Skills Demonstrated: Data scraping, NLP, sentiment analysis, time series analysis, and data visualization.
4. Supply Chain Optimization Model
Project Overview: Create a simulation or optimization model for a company's supply chain that addresses common challenges such as inventory levels, demand forecasting, supplier selection, and logistics costs.
Objective: To propose solutions for reducing costs, improving efficiency, and ensuring the timely delivery of products.
Skills Demonstrated: Operations research, linear programming, machine learning, decision analysis, and visualization of complex supply chain networks.
